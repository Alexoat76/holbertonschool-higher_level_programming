# 0x09. Python - Everything is object
<div style="text-align: justify">

In this project, you should to learn and practice about `Object Oriented Programming` using `classes` and `objects` in Python. Learn how to use the `class methods`, and
`static methods`, differences between `class vs instance attributes`, and how to use the special `__str__` and `__repr__` methods.

Don't forget to fully meet the following development requirements.

* [Object Oriented Programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html)((Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
* [Object Oriented Programming](https://python-course.eu/oop/object-oriented-programming.php)((Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The `__init__` Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “`__str__`- and `__repr__`-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”))
* [Class and Instance Attributes](https://python-course.eu/oop/class-instance-attributes.php)
* [classmethods and staticmethods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8cL2XMM5M)
* [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://python-course.eu/oop/properties-vs-getters-and-setters.php)(Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
* [str vs repr](https://shipit.dev/posts/python-str-vs-repr.html)
